This project is carried out within an academic context and is based on collaborative group work.

It applies the CRISP-DM methodology to develop a Machine Learning model for predicting customer churn in a US-based telecom company.

Additionally, SHAP is utilized to interpret and explain the modelâ€™s predictions, enhancing transparency, trust, and providing valuable business insights into the key drivers of customer churn.
