## ✨ Project Overview

This project applies the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to develop a Machine Learning model for predicting customer churn in a US-based telecom company.

Additionally, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is utilized to interpret and explain the model’s predictions, enhancing transparency, trust, and providing valuable business insights into the key drivers of customer churn.
